install required dependency packages:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y raspberrypi-kernal-headers
sudo apt install -y build-essential
sudo reboot

STEPS:

->In terminal mkdir __yours__
->touch kernal_hi.c Makefile
->nano->/vim kernal_hi.c
->write your code in kernal_hi.c and use ctrl + s for save and ctrl + x for exit
->and then write your Makefile
->nano/vim Makefile
->write your code in Makefile and use ctrl + s for save and ctrl + x for exit
->once everything is done in terminal type make to build the file
->once the build over check uisng ls. And search of a file having .ko extension which is a kernalfie
->use tmux for muliplexing terminal for easy debugging
->in one parallel terminal type the sudo dmesg -w for checking the kernal logs
->in another parallel terminal load the .ko to the kernal type "sudo insmod kernal_hi.ko"
->you will find the printed statement on the kernal logs
->and for unloading the .ko to the kernal type "sudo rmmod kernal_hi.ko"
->use modinfo kernal_hi.ko for getting the metadata information about the driver
->use lsmod to list all the kernal modules
->use lsmod | grep "module name" to search the name by filtering
